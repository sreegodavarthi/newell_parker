                    <strong>How long is the warranty valid?</strong>
                </p>
                <p>If your pen was purchased with a lifetime warranty, the lifetime warranty will be honored. In 2007 we introduced
                    a limited warranty period of 2 years with the option of a free 2 year extension. All repairs covered
                    under the warranty require proof of the terms of the warranty, either the dealer stamped and dated warranty
                    document or the printed sales receipt showing the product and date of purchase.</p>

                    <strong>How can I make sure the warranty will be honored?</strong>
                </p>
                <p>By retaining your warranty document and your printed sales receipt, you will be eligible for repair of your
                    writing instrument for the timeframe and conditions outlined within the warranty document provided at
                    time of purchase.</p>

                </p>
                <p>If the repair does not fall under the warranty, we will send you a quote for approval once we have inspected
                    the damage. If you do not accept our quote, we will not charge you any shipping or handling fees to return
                    the writing instrument to you. Please see

                    <strong>What does the warranty cover?</strong>
                </p>
                <p>The warranty covers defects in materials and workmanship. It does not cover damage due to misuse or abuse,
                    missing parts, or normal wear and tear. Also, use of accessories that are not Parker branded such as
                    refills, cartridges and bottled ink will void the warranty. For information regarding our repair services

                </p>
                <p>We do offer a nib exchange service. Fine and medium nibs are available for all of our fountain pen models.
                    If you are interested in another nib size please determine the size required and contact us at 800-237-8736.
                    <br>If the nib we receive is in perfect condition and if the new required nib belongs to the same model we
                    will carry out the nib exchange free of charge. Otherwise you will receive a quote.
                    <br>We do recommend that you return the complete pen in order to protect the nib during transit.
                    <br>Please be sure to include all of your contact information with the pen so that we may reach you easily.
                    For products offered or purchased more than 10 years ago, we ask that you send a digital picture of your
                    pen so we can identify the model.</p>

                        <li>Insert the cartridge into the gripping section of the barrel. Apply slight pressure until you feel
                            and hear the cartridge seat into place.</li>
                        <li>The gripping section will pierce the cartridge, allowing the ink to flow into the feed assembly.</li>
                        <li>Screw the bottom section of the barrel on over the cartridge into the gripping section of the barrel.</li>
                    </ul>

                            section.</li>
                        <li> Dip the nib of the fountain pen into the bottled ink so that the nib is submerged slightly below
                            the gripping section.</li>
                        <li>Remove the nib from the bottled ink and twist or slide the plunger slightly to force out three drops
                            of ink back into the bottle.</li>
                        <li>Twist or slide the plunger back up to the top position to draw a little air into the converter.</li>
